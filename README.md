# A-survey-form-on-survey-forms
My first project on freecodecamp .. my first project ever actually :D
I know it looks bad now, but the plan is to learn how to use git hub by making new commits to the project as I learn new concepts in front end development.

##update
This part has been added manually using git on bash in vs studio, as the github desktop app had fatal errors. 
This was a difficult task that was also rewarding. After a few hours, it turned out that I couldn't commit anything either because I hadn't pressed save first , or because i didn't type git add! I thought vs code saves on its own.. my bad.. this isn't google docs.
